# Outreach

This is an experiment.  The goal is to deliver resources for education and outreach resources on the Chalcidoidea via a Jekyll website using simple Markdown documents to produce content.

# Updating the site

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based website.  There's lots of nice instructions there as to what is going on. Editing any file here automatically triggers a rebuild of the site.

## Adding content with Markdown

A majority of the content here is written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Taxon Pages

To add a taxon page add a Markdown formatted file to the `_diversity` directory.

### Education modules

To add a module add a Markdown formatted file to the `_diversity` directory.  Ultimately you will also add individual elements as well, where is yet to be determined.

### Outreach

... coming, will follow Education idea

## Images

Add a image (no larger that 1mb please!) to `assesets/images`.
